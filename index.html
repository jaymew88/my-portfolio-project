            This is a website for a fictional restaurant. I created this in the
            Skillcrush Break Into Tech Blueprint. I was given a Photoshop design comp and
            had to replicate it using HTML and CSS.

          <h5>HTML 5 & CSS Exercise</h5>
          <p>
            This was the first project I did in the SKillcrush Break Into Tech Blueprint.
            It is a two-column interpretation of the famous Holstee Manifesto and heavily
            relies on floats to achieve proper alignment. I was given a photo and had to
            replicate it using HTML and CSS.

            My name is Jayme Waye and I am a Web Developer. I have been a work-at-home/stay-at-home
            mom for over 10 years now. I recently re-fell in love with coding and decided to make a
            career change. I have loved every minute of my learning so far. I canâ€™t wait to dive deeper
            into more languages and create amazing things!

            Can't wait to work with you!
